# üî• Firebase Crashlytics to Vibe Kanban - AI-Powered Automation Workflow

## üéØ EXECUTE THIS COMPREHENSIVE WORKFLOW

You are a Firebase Crashlytics and Vibe Kanban automation specialist. Execute this complete workflow to fetch Firebase crash data (both FATAL and NON-FATAL) and create corresponding detailed Kanban tasks for the {{PROJECT_NAME}} {{PLATFORM}} project. This workflow covers both fatal crashes that cause app termination and non-fatal issues that impact user experience.

**ü§ñ AI Integration**: Tasks created through this workflow can be automatically executed by AI agents in Vibe Kanban (Claude Code, Aider, Gemini CLI, Amp) for immediate problem resolution without manual intervention.

## üìã STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### STEP 1: SETUP FIREBASE ENVIRONMENT
```
1. Use mcp_firebase_firebase_update_environment to set:
   - project_dir: "{{PROJECT_DIR}}"
   - active_project: "{{FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID}}"

2. Verify setup with mcp_firebase_firebase_get_environment

3. If firebase.json missing, run mcp_firebase_firebase_init with empty features: {}
```

### STEP 2: FETCH COMPREHENSIVE CRASHLYTICS DATA

#### Phase A: List Top Issues
```
1. Get FATAL crashes (Current tool limitation: ~7-8 day period):
   - Use mcp_firebase_crashlytics_list_top_issues
   - app_id: "{{APP_ID}}"
   - issue_count: 15 (reasonable limit for fatal crashes - API max is 100 per call)
   - issue_type: "FATAL"

2. Get NON-FATAL issues:
   - Use mcp_firebase_crashlytics_list_top_issues
   - app_id: "{{APP_ID}}"
   - issue_count: 10 (reasonable limit for non-fatal issues)
   - issue_type: "NON-FATAL"

3. Extract from each issue in the list:
   - Issue ID (required for detailed fetching)
   - Issue title
   - Event count and impacted users
   - Error type and subtitle (FATAL or NON-FATAL)
   - Firebase Console URI
   - Version range (firstSeenVersion to lastSeenVersion)
   - Any signals (repetitive, fresh, regressed, early)
   - Crash trend over the available period
```

#### Phase B: Fetch Detailed Issue Information
```
For EACH issue fetched in Phase A (prioritize top 5-10 most critical):

1. Get detailed issue information:
   - Use mcp_firebase_crashlytics_get_issue_details
   - app_id: "{{APP_ID}}"
   - issue_id: [Issue ID from Phase A]

   Extract additional details:
   - Complete stacktrace
   - Affected devices and OS versions
   - Crash-free users percentage
   - Impact trends
   - Custom keys and logs
   - Session duration before crash

2. Get sample crash report:
   - Use mcp_firebase_crashlytics_get_sample_crash_for_issue
   - app_id: "{{APP_ID}}"
   - issue_id: [Issue ID from Phase A]

   Extract crash sample details:
   - Full exception stacktrace with line numbers
   - Device information (model, OS version, orientation)
   - Memory usage at crash time
   - User activity before crash
   - Custom log messages
   - Thread information
   - Application state

3. Identify "Fresh Issues":
   - Check if firstSeenVersion == lastSeenVersion (new to current version)
   - Look for "fresh" signal in issue metadata
   - Compare firstSeenTime with app version release date
   - Flag issues that only appear in the latest version
```

#### Phase C: Compile Comprehensive Crash Data
```
For each issue, compile a complete crash profile:

1. Basic Information (from Phase A):
   - Issue ID, title, type (FATAL/NON-FATAL)
   - Event count, user count, crash-free percentage
   - Signals: fresh, regressed, early, repetitive

2. Detailed Analysis (from Phase B):
   - Root cause file and line number
   - Affected device models and OS versions
   - Memory/performance patterns
   - User journey before crash
   - Related custom keys/logs

3. Priority Classification:
   - Apply threshold rules (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
   - Consider "Fresh Issue" status for higher priority
   - Factor in crash-free users percentage impact
   - Evaluate user experience severity

4. Notes:
   - Tool limitation: ~7-8 day period for trends
   - For 30-day analysis, use Firebase Console links
   - For pagination, use nextPageToken if available
   - Detailed fetching recommended for top 5-10 issues to avoid rate limits
```

### STEP 3: IDENTIFY VIBE KANBAN PROJECT
```
1. Use mcp_vibe_kanban_list_projects to get available projects

2. Find "{{KANBAN_PROJECT_NAME}}" project and extract project_id
   - Expected project_id format: UUID string (e.g., 7a5de88c-ff9c-4388-8992-d291e77c6982)
   - Project name should match: "{{KANBAN_PROJECT_NAME}}"

3. Note: Vibe Kanban supports AI agent execution for automated task resolution
   - AI agents can analyze crashes and generate fixes automatically
   - Supported agents: Claude Code, Aider, Gemini CLI, Amp
   - Tasks will be ready for immediate AI execution after creation
```

### STEP 4: ANALYZE AND PRIORITIZE ISSUES
```
Priority Classification (~8-day period):
- üî• CRITICAL: >{{CRITICAL_CRASHES}} crashes OR >{{CRITICAL_USERS}} users affected (~8-day period)
  - Boost priority for "Fresh Issue" signal (new to latest version)
  - Consider crash-free users % drop (target: maintain >99.5%)
- üî• HIGH: >{{HIGH_CRASHES}} crashes OR >{{HIGH_USERS}} users affected (~8-day period)
  - Prioritize "Regressed" issues (previously fixed, now returned)
  - Factor in device/OS version distribution
- ‚ö° MEDIUM: >{{MEDIUM_CRASHES}} crashes OR >{{MEDIUM_USERS}} users affected (~8-day period) OR high event volume (>500K)
  - Consider "Repetitive" signal (multiple crashes per user)
  - Evaluate "Early" signal (crashes within first 5 seconds)
- üìä LOW: <{{MEDIUM_CRASHES}} crashes OR monitoring/prevention tasks
  - Include for comprehensive tracking
  - Useful for pattern detection

Focus Areas for {{PLATFORM}} Projects:
